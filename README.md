## Prerequisites

- Java 17 or higher
- Maven 3.6+
- MySQL 8.0+
- Git

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thathsaraDinu/Operion-Workforce-Operations-Platform.git
   cd Operion-Workforce-Operations-Platform
   ```

2. **Configure MySQL Database**
   - Create a MySQL database named `operion`
   - Update database credentials in `src/main/resources/application.properties`:
     ```properties
     spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/operion
     spring.datasource.username=your_username
     spring.datasource.password=your_password
     ```

3. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   ./mvnw clean install
   ```
   Or on Windows:
   ```bash
   mvnw.cmd clean install
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```
   Or on Windows:
   ```bash
   mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
   ```

The application will start on `http://localhost:8080`

## API Documentation

Once the application is running, access the interactive API documentation at:

- **Swagger UI**: `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`
- **OpenAPI JSON**: `http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs`

## Standard Response Format

All API endpoints return a consistent response structure:

## Authentication

All endpoints (except `/api/auth/login`) require JWT authentication in the request header:

To obtain a JWT token, use the login endpoint:
```bash
POST /api/auth/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "password"
}
```

## Database Migrations

The application uses Flyway for database migrations. Migration scripts are located in:
- `src/main/resources/db/migration/`

Initial schema is automatically created when the application starts.

## Configuration

Key configuration properties in `src/main/resources/application.properties`:

- **Server Port**: Default 8080
- **Database**: MySQL connection settings
- **JWT Secret**: Secret key for token generation
- **JPA Settings**: Hibernate configuration and SQL logging

## Development

### Testing

The project includes comprehensive unit tests for critical business logic using JUnit 5 and Mockito. Test coverage focuses on:

**Test Suites:**
- **EmployeeServiceTest**: Employee creation, validation, updates, and department assignment
- **LeaveServiceTest**: Leave request workflow, approval process, and authorization checks  
- **AttendanceServiceTest**: Clock-in/clock-out validation and attendance record management
- **AuthServiceTest**: Authentication flow and JWT token generation

**Key Test Coverage:**
- Business rule validation (email uniqueness, date ranges, time logic)
- Authorization and access control (role-based permissions, ownership verification)
- State management (pending-only updates, attendance state transitions)
- Error handling (proper exception throwing for invalid operations)
- Data integrity (foreign key validation, entity relationships)

**Running Tests:**
```bash
./mvnw test
```

**Running Specific Test Class:**
```bash
./mvnw test -Dtest=EmployeeServiceTest
```

### Code Formatting
The project uses Lombok to reduce boilerplate code. Ensure you have the Lombok plugin installed in your IDE.

### Adding New Features
1. Create entity in `entity/` package
2. Create repository in `repository/` package
3. Create DTOs in `dto/` package
4. Create mapper in `mapper/` package
5. Create service interface and implementation in `service/` package
6. Create controller in `controller/` package
7. Add Flyway migration script if database changes are needed

## Security Considerations

- Change the default JWT secret in production
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Enable HTTPS in production
- Regularly update dependencies
- Rate limiting implemented for password reset endpoints (3 requests per 15 minutes per email/IP)
- Password complexity requirements for user-set passwords (minimum 8 characters, uppercase, lowercase, number, special character)
- Temporary passwords set by HR have relaxed validation (minimum 6 characters)
- Password history tracking to prevent reuse of passwords from the last year
- Account lockout after 5 failed login attempts (30-minute lockout)
- Session invalidation on password changes via password versioning
- HR cannot update employee passwords after account creation (employees manage their own passwords)
